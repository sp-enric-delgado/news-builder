## Bug Report

### Image Form Component

1. When updating the form value, sometimes gets stuck and doesn't go up. **SOLUTION**: move the canvas object, and the data repairs itself. Usually happens when launching the render for the first time. Maybe has something to do with the `imagePositionDict` initial value?
2. Form values have far too many decimals.
